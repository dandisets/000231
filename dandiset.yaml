description: Mice adeptly use their whiskers to touch, recognize, and learn about
  objects in their environment. This ability is enabled by computations performed
  by populations of neurons in the somatosensory cortex. To understand how, we trained
  mice to use their whiskers to recognize different shapes and we recorded activity
  in the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input. Here, we present a large dataset
  of high-speed video of the whiskers, along with rigorous tracking of the entire
  extent of multiple whiskers and every contact they made on the shape. We also used
  spike sorting to identify individual neurons, which responded with precise timing
  to whisker contacts and motion. These data will be useful for understanding the
  sensory and motor strategies mice use to identify objects by touch, as well as the
  neuronal responses and computations that mediate these strategies. More generally,
  this carefully curated labeled data could be used to develop computer vision algorithms
  for tracking body posture, or for extracting responses of individual neurons from
  large-scale neural recordings.

description: 'I recently collected a large dataset to understand how mice recognize
  objects using their whiskers. I used high-speed video to capture the motion of individually
  identified whiskers, and identified every single contact each whisker made on the
  objects. I also recorded large populations of individual neurons in the somatosensory
  cortex while they did this. This dataset aligns the video, neural, and behavioral
  datasets in a unified Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) file. I also provide the original
  raw data files as well. These data will be useful for understanding the neural computations
  of object recognition, for developing new software to track animal behavior in video,
  and for developing new software for identifying individual neurons in large extracellular
  recordings. '
